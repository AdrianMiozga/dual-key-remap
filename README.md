# Windows Dual Key Remap: Capslock to Ctrl/Escape

Remap any key to any other two keys on Windows. Most commonly used to remap capslock to escape when pressed alone and ctrl when pressed with other keys. Written in C to run at the lowest Windows API level for speed and reliability ðŸ”¥.

## Motivation

Current implementations of this keybinding are slow, swallow/leak inputs, or don't handle edge cases.

Dual Key Remap runs at the lowest level making it both fast and reliable with an absolutely tiny cpu footprint.

## Installation

1) Download and unzip the latest release.
2) Put both 'dual-key-remap.exe' and 'config.txt' in a permament directory of your choice. (e.g. `C:\Program Files\dual-key-remap`).
3) Create a shortcut to 'dual-key-remap.exe' in your startup directory (e.g. `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\dual-key-remap.lnk`).
4) Optionally edit config.txt (see below) and run 'dual-key-remap.exe'. Your chosen keys are now remapped!

## Settings
By default the dual-key-remap will remap capslock to trigger ctrl when pressed with another key and escape when pressed alone. To change this simply edit config.txt and change the remapped keys. Refer to keys by their [virtual key codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/inputdev/virtual-key-codes). The characters A-Z and 0-9 can be referred to literally.

An example config.txt could look like this:

```
remap_key=VK_MENU
when_alone=A
with_other=VK_CONTROL
```

This would remap the alt key (VK_MENU) to output 'A' when tapped alone and control when pressed with other keys.

To uninstall, terminate the script from the task manager and remove the startup shortcut.
